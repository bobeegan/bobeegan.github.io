                    Java is a free, open-sourced Object Oriented programming (OOP) language owned by Oracle. 
                    Among its many uses are mobile, web and desktop applications, as well as games and 
                    database connections. It works across many different platforms and its clear and 
                    easy to understand structure makes Java programs versatile and reusable. 
                    It is syntactically similar to C# and C++, making it easy for developers to switch 
                    between languages if the need arises. These features make Java one of the most popular
                    and in-demand languages.

                <p>Lets take a look at a Java "Hello World" program</p>
                <code>
                    public class Demo 
                    <br>
                        {   
                            <br>
                                public static void main(String[] args)
                            <br>
                            {
                                <br>
                                System.out.println("Hello World!");
                                <br>
                            }
                        <br>   
                    }
                </code>
                <p>
                    The above program shows the very basics of Java syntax-
                    <ul>
                        <li>class declaration- we've called this program "Demo"</li>
                        <li>main method- in parentheses, a parameter is specified- in this instance it is a String array</li>
                        <li>System.out.println method is called- this prints the text within the quotes</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </section>

                <header>Java Classes and Objects</header>
                <p>
                    In object oriented programming, objects containing methods and data are created, allowing programmers
                    to reference these objects in their code without individually restating all of the object's qualities
                    or procedures. Objects are specific instances of classes, in the same way that "coffee", "tea" and "water" are all 
                    specific types of beverage. This is why OOP is so versatile. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    As an example, if you needed to creat an address book, using Java you could create a class 
                    representing an address and all its associated data. To do this, you could create a class 
                    called "address", then give it string attributes representing a mailing address and an 
                    associated name. This class then allows you to instantiate "address" objects with specific names
                    and addresses which can then be referenced and manipulated as needed through various methods as 
                    needed.

            <section class="main-section" id="Method">
                <header>Methods</header>
                <p>
                    A Java method or function is a block of code that runs only when it is called and must be 
                    declared within a class. Methods can contain parameters, which are variables that are used 
                    in the operation of the method. These parameters can be many types of data, for instance 
                    Strings or Integers, and the data type must be defined in the method's name. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    This is useful because once you have defined a method, you do not need to do so again and 
                    can reuse it as needed, saving time and simplifying code. Java has many predefined methods,
                    including System.out.println() which is used in the "Hello World" example, but you can create 
                    your own as needed.
                </p>

            <section class="main-section" id="Inheritance">
                <header>Inheritance</header>
                <p>
                    Methods in Java can be inherited from one class to another- from a designated superclass to a 
                    designated subclass. This is done using the keyword "extends" where the subclass extends the 
                    superclass.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p> 
                    This is useful when you need multiple specific versions of a class. For example, say you had a
                    "vehicle" class with an attribute defining the number of wheels and a method for acceleration. 
                    You could then create two subclasses called "car" and "truck". Both would inherit the 
                    original attributes and methods of the vehicle class, but you could give each new class its own
                    new parameters as well, and then instantiate "car" or "truck" objects. These instantiated objects 
                    would all inherit the method for accelerating without specifically defining that 
                    method in the "car" or "truck" classes- but if you gave the "truck" class a honk method and the 
                    "car" class a breaking method, you could not call the honk method on a "car" object or the break
                    method on a "truck" object.
                </p>

            <section class="main-section" id="Exceptions">
                <header>Exceptions</header>
                <p>
                    An exception occurs when there is an error in the execution of a Java program. In this event,
                    Java will throw an error message. The "try" and "catch" statements allow you to specify blocks
                    of code to be tested for errors or executed in the event of an error, respectively. This allows
                    you to find how and where errors are occurring- whether that is because of end user error, a 
                    problem in the code itself, or something else. Furthermore, a throw statement can be used in
                    conjunction with a specific exception type- for instance a FileNotFoundException or 
                    ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException- in order to display specific text when an exception occurs.
